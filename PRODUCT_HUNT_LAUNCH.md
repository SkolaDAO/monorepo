## 📖 Description (Full)

## The Problem

Course platforms take too much and pay too slow:
- Udemy: Takes 63% of your earnings
- Teachable/Kajabi: $39-399/month before you make a dollar
- All of them: Net-30 payment delays

## The Solution

Skola is a course marketplace built on Base (Ethereum L2) where:

**💰 You Keep 92%**
Flat 8% platform fee. No monthly subscriptions. No hidden costs.

**⚡ Instant Payments**
Get paid in ETH or USDC the moment someone buys. Not in 30 days. Not "pending review." Immediately.

**🔗 Built on Web3 Rails**
Your course, your content, your money. Payments go directly to your wallet.

**🤝 Referral System**
3% to anyone who shares your course. Built-in affiliate marketing.

## Who It's For

- Crypto/Web3 educators teaching where their students already are
- Course creators tired of platform fees eating their margins
- Anyone who wants to own their education business, not rent it

## How It Works

1. Connect your wallet
2. Create your course (set price in USD, receive crypto)
3. Share your link
4. Get paid instantly when someone buys

No approval process. No content review delays. Publish when you're ready.

## Tech Stack

- Smart contracts on Base (low fees, fast transactions)
- Chainlink price feeds for accurate USD pricing
- USDC and ETH payment options
- Upgradeable contracts for continuous improvement

## 💬 Maker's First Comment

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Skola because I was tired of watching course platforms take 63% of creator earnings while making them wait 30+ days to get paid.

The math never made sense to me:
- You create the content
- You bring the audience
- You do the marketing
- ...and the platform takes the majority?

Skola flips this:
→ 92% to creators (8% flat fee)
→ Instant payments to your wallet
→ No monthly subscriptions
→ Built on Base for low transaction fees

We're starting with web3/crypto educators because they already have wallets and understand the value of ownership. But the vision is bigger—any creator should be able to own their business, not rent it from a platform.

Would love your feedback! What features would make you switch from your current platform?

## ❓ FAQ / Common Questions

**Q: Why crypto payments?**
A: Instant settlement, lower fees than credit cards at scale, and true ownership. Your money goes directly to your wallet—we never hold it.

**Q: What if my students don't have crypto?**
A: They can buy ETH or USDC through the app with a card (via onramp partners). Once they have a wallet, purchasing is one click.

**Q: Is my content stored on-chain?**
A: Course metadata and ownership are on-chain. Content is stored off-chain for performance, but you maintain full control.

**Q: What blockchain is Skola on?**
A: Base—an Ethereum L2 by Coinbase. Fast, cheap, and secure.

**Q: Can I price in USD?**
A: Yes! Set your price in USD, and buyers pay the equivalent in ETH or USDC using live Chainlink price feeds.
