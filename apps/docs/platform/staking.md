# Creator Registration

## Pay Once, Publish Forever

Unlike traditional platforms with monthly fees, we use a one-time payment model.

**For creators:** Pay once to unlock course publishing. No recurring charges.

**For learners:** Paid creators have skin in the game. They're incentivized to deliver quality.

## How It Works

1. Pay $10 minimum (in ETH or USDC) to publish your first course
2. Your tier is permanent - no expiration
3. Upgrade anytime by paying the difference
4. Higher tiers = more course slots

## Payment Options

You can pay using either:

| Asset | Network |
|-------|---------|
| **ETH** | Base |
| **USDC** | Base |

Both are accepted at current market rates. Choose whichever you prefer.

## Tiers

| Tier | Price | Active Courses | Perks |
|------|-------|----------------|-------|
| Starter | $10 | 1 | Basic analytics |
| Pro | $50 | 5 | Featured placement lottery |
| Elite | $200 | Unlimited | Priority support |

## Upgrading Tiers

Already registered? You only pay the difference:

- Starter → Pro: Pay $40 (not $50)
- Starter → Elite: Pay $190 (not $200)
- Pro → Elite: Pay $150 (not $200)

Your previous payment is always credited.
