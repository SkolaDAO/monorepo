## Early Supporter Airdrop (10%)

This is specifically for creators who paid with ETH/USDC before token launch:

| Tier | Payment | Airdrop Weight |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Starter | $10 | 1x |
| Pro | $50 | 5x |
| Elite | $200 | 20x |

**Example calculation:**
- If 1000 Starter, 200 Pro, 50 Elite creators register
- Total weights: 1000×1 + 200×5 + 50×20 = 3000
- Each weight = 10M / 3000 = 3,333 tokens
- Starter gets ~3,333 tokens
- Pro gets ~16,666 tokens  
- Elite gets ~66,666 tokens

*Numbers are illustrative. Actual amounts depend on total registrations.*

## No Investors

**Intentionally:**
- No private sale
- No VC allocation
- No advisors with large allocations

Why? We want long-term aligned holders, not short-term flippers.
