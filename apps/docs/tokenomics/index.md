## Token Plans

We plan to launch a governance token that will:
- Reward early creators and learners
- Enable platform governance
- Distribute protocol fees to stakers

**No token exists yet.** We're focused on building a useful product first.

Early users of the platform (creators and buyers) will be considered for future airdrops based on their activity.

## Philosophy

We're building Skola differently:

1. **Product first** — Token comes after product-market fit
2. **Sustainable** — Revenue from fees, not speculation
3. **Fair launch** — No VC allocation, community-first
4. **Transparent** — Open source, on-chain, verifiable
