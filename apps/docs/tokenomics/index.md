# Roadmap

## Current State: Phase 1

Skola is live with core functionality:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Creator registration (ETH/USDC) | Live |
| One-time payment, no subscription | Live |
| Course publishing | Live |
| Payments (ETH/USDC) | Live |
| Referral system (3%) | Live |
| Base network | Live |

## Early Supporter Airdrop

::: tip Pay Now, Get Tokens Later
All creators who register with ETH or USDC before our token launch will receive $LEARN tokens.

| Tier | Airdrop Allocation |
|------|-------------------|
| Starter ($10) | Base allocation |
| Pro ($50) | 5x allocation |
| Elite ($200) | 20x allocation |

**This is tracked automatically on-chain. No signup or claim needed.**

## Phase 2: Growth

Coming next:

- **Course content hosting** - IPFS for metadata, optimized video delivery
- **Creator analytics** - Sales, views, engagement metrics
- **Reviews & ratings** - Community feedback system
- **Categories & search** - Better course discovery
- **Community chat** - Buyers can discuss courses together
- **Creator DMs** - Direct communication with course creators

## Phase 3: Token Launch

Once we have real traction and liquidity makes sense:

### Why Wait?

Launching a token without usage is putting the cart before the horse. We're building real value first, then adding a token that captures that value.

### Planned Token Utility

| Use Case | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Creator registration | Alternative to ETH/USDC payment |
| Payment discount | 5% off for learners |
| Protocol staking | Earn share of fees |
| Governance | Vote on protocol parameters |

### No VC, No Presale

We're bootstrapping:
- No private investors
- No presale dumping
- Community-first distribution
- Early ETH/USDC payers get airdrop

See [Token Utility](/tokenomics/utility) and [Distribution](/tokenomics/distribution) for the planned design.

## Phase 4: Decentralization

Long-term goals:

- **Full DAO governance** - Community controls treasury and upgrades
- **Multi-chain** - Expand beyond Base
- **Protocol-owned liquidity** - Sustainable token liquidity
- **Advanced features** - Subscriptions, bundles, cohort-based courses

## Why This Order?

```
Build Product → Get Users → Prove Value → Launch Token → Reward Early Users
```

Not:

```
Launch Token → Hope for Users → ???
```

We're doing it the hard way because it's the right way.
