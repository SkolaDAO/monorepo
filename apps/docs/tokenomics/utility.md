# Token Utility (Planned)

::: warning Future Feature
The $LEARN token is not yet live. This page describes the planned design for when we have sufficient platform usage and liquidity to launch responsibly.
:::

## Why a Token?

The token will create aligned incentives:

1. **Creators stake to publish** - Token demand from creators
2. **Learners get discount** - Token demand from learners  
3. **Stakers earn fees** - Long-term holding incentive
4. **Buyback & burn** - Supply reduction over time

No inflationary rewards. Real utility, real demand.

## Planned Utility

### 1. Creator Staking (Alternative)

Creators will be able to stake with $LEARN as an alternative to ETH/USDC:

| Tier | Stake Required | Courses Allowed |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Starter | $10 in $LEARN | 1 |
| Pro | $50 in $LEARN | 5 |
| Elite | $200 in $LEARN | Unlimited |

### 2. Payment Discount

Learners will get 5% off when paying with $LEARN:

- $100 course → Pay $95 in $LEARN
- Automatic discount, no codes needed
- Creates organic demand from learners

### 3. Protocol Staking

Stake $LEARN to earn a share of protocol fees:

- 40% of all protocol fees to stakers
- Proportional to stake amount
- Continuous distribution
- No lockup required

### 4. Governance

$LEARN holders will vote on:

- Protocol fee percentage
- Staking requirements  
- Treasury spending
- New features

## Current Alternatives

Right now, without a token:

| Feature | Current | With Token |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Creator staking | ETH or USDC | ETH, USDC, or $LEARN |
| Payments | ETH or USDC | ETH, USDC, or $LEARN (5% off) |
| Fee earning | Not available | Stake $LEARN to earn |
| Governance | Team decisions | Token holder votes |

The platform works fully without a token. The token adds benefits, not requirements.

## Launch Criteria

We'll launch the token when:

1. **Real usage** - Meaningful GMV and active creators
2. **Proven model** - Fee structure validated
3. **Liquidity plan** - Sustainable DEX liquidity
4. **Community** - Active users who want to participate

No artificial timelines. When it makes sense.
